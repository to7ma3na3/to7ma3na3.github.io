      <p> Price wass $25. I visited N-zoo with my daughter. But tickets were sold out at 5 pm. They make limit to the number of visiters, I guess. We bought tickests for next Saturday 3 pm. <br> I thought it was expensive at first. But my image was Japanese Zoo. But as for this zoo, I could enjoyed much more than that. So I'd like to visit the zoo agein.<br> I found the price of the ticket changes just like the flight tickets.
      I wonder how they ddeside it each day.

      <p> This N-Zoo is about 10 minutes from Hurding Place interchange by car. Prking is free for members and 4 dollars for none menbers.<br>Actually, it takes 15 minutes from our house. So close. And there's an international market close by which we go very often.<br>T-zoo is just like a wide nature area where many zoo amimals are living. We can go there to join the animals and feel the nature. </p>

        <p>There are many kinds of birds all around the zoo. Some birds are on the trees above your head and some are on children's hands.<br>  There were Japanese carps in the stream. So it looked like Japanese big garden.<br>Big strong animals are there, of course. you can see them just the other side of a thick glass.<br>Graff must be the simble of this zoo. they are beyond a river. there's not many fenses. So you can feel animals very close.</p>

      <p> The path of N-zoo was the type of maze. visitors can have feeling of expedition. there are camping base and rope bridge and a rope rider, too. But the path are clearn and everybosy incliding little child or wheelchair user can enjoy walking through the zoo.<br>There are enough rest areas, and visitors can eat and enjoy shopping soveniors, too. We saw many families including little kids enjoying rides or having barbecue, etc.<br>N-zoo is like a maze, so it has a map. But if it has road guide on website, it will be more helpful.</p>

      <p>N-zoo has good air to breathe in the nature. It planted many trees, bambooes, plants and flowers. So it is also can be botanical garden.<br>It also have event house and many plans for events. There is also camping site to stay all night and watch stars.<br>There are many spots where visitors can touch and talk to animails. N-zoo staff is taking care of the sopt and visitors were waiting in line.</p>

      <p>Many visiters say that the Zoo is clean and enjoyed not only looking animals but also many experiences.<br>
        Some visitor said: While on a vacation / anniversory, we enjoyed visiting N-zoo! Even though it was raining off and on... we still loved the zoo. My wife loved seeing the monkeys in the wewmen's restroom. How fun.<r>Other said: We had the BBQ for lunch amd it was delicious!! The animals were beautiful and seamed very well taken care of which is very important to me. The trails are a bit confusing, ...  </p>

      <p>I don't know the real business of N-zoo, but it gave me many hints about making business. This is a zoo. But if looking animals is the only purpose to visit here, visiteors will be restricted. But if they come here with their family to enjoy their time with the clean nature including animals, it will become one of the parts of their lives. <br>And if the zoo is very comfortable place for animals and for staffs, it means N-zoo is growing healthy. Healthy zoo can welcome many more visitors.</p>

      <p>I enjoyed Nashville zoo a lot, too. I like its clean trail where I can enjoy the nature with the animals the best. I like the idea of activity which gives us many experiences like watching stars at night. <br>If N-zoo can privide experiences to take care of some of the animals or plants just like its staff, many children will feel like to try it, I think. those experiences will teach them the importance of lives and responsibility we people have to take. It is a good spot and chance for education, too.</p>
